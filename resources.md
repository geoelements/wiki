## Asana
The lab's Asana (https://app.asana.com/) should be used to manage all your tasks and projects. List every task you need to accomplish on Asana. Tasks should be managable entities, preferably less than 6 hours of work. If it takes longer, break it into subtasks. Provide weekly status updates on Asana. You can also assign tasks to Krishna if you like him to read through your documents/write-ups or review the code. 

## Calendly
To book meetings with Krishna, use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/krishnakut/30min?). Make sure to update Asana with the meeting agenda and send all relevant documents to Krishna at least 2 hours before the meeting. 

## GitHub
The lab’s GitHub (https://github.com/geoelements) should be used to share code, docs, and wiki with the world. We develop open source code, so there is no embargo between code development and public accessibility. Always write tests and comments, because we don’t want to distribute buggy code to the world! Have other lab members check it if possible.

## Slack
[Geoelements Slack](https://geoelements.slack.com) will be used as the primary means of lab communication. When posting messages or looking for updates, check the appropriate channel: `#general` for lab announcements, `#brain-trust` for communication related to BrainTrust meetings, `#papers` for sharing links to lab-relevant papers and discussing them, `#status-updates` for status updates, `#books-articles` for interesting books and articles you have read, `#conferences` for any relevant conference, and `#random` for non-work-related chatting that is best kept out of the work-related channels.

Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can subscribe only to the channels that concern them. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to send attachments (e.g., papers) or send messages that include out-of-lab recipients, use e-mail. If it’s an emergency and Krishna isn’t responding on Slack, e-mail him or call him if it is urgent.

Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers. Do not install it on your phone, we do not expect everyone to be on Slack all the time. Treat Slack like emails as asynchronous communication system.


## UT box
The lab has a shared UT Box account that is used to store experiment data, so that you can run your experiment on any computer that has access to the lab UT Box folder. The lab UT Box is also used to store documents and files for general lab use (e.g., documents, papers, data, results, etc). Contact Krishna to get access to the lab UT Box.


## Wiki
This Geoelements [wiki](https://github.com/geoelements/wiki) has all of the information you need to get started, including tasks that need to be done upon arrival, day-to-day housekeeping duties, forms and flyers, programming and modeling tips, information about accessing the high-performance computing clusters. Edit it when you obtain information that will be useful for others to know! You can also create wikis of your research documentation. Contact Krishna for further information.
