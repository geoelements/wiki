# Top-10 tips for writing a paper
> Jim Kurose, Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts

1. Every paper tells a story. 
    * what is the “elevator pitch” of your story? (elevator pitch = summary that is short enough to give during an elevator ride)
    * the story is not what you did, but rather: (i) what you show, new ideas, new insights, and (ii) why interesting, important?
    * why is the story of interest to others? - universal truths, hot topic, surprises or unexpected results?
    * know your story!

1. Write top down
    * scientists (and most human beings) think this way!
    * state broad themes/ideas first, then go into detail (context, context, context)
    * even when going into detail … write top down!

1. Introduction: crucial, formulaic
    * if reader not excited by intro, paper is lost

    * Structure
        - para. 1: motivation: broadly, what is the problem area, why is it important? 
        
        - para. 2: narrow down: what is problem you specifically consider

        - para. 3: “In the paper, we ….”: most crucial paragraph, tell your elevator pitch
        
        - para. 4: how different/better/relates to other work
        
        - para. 5: “The remainder of this paper is structured as follows”

1. Master the basics of organized writing
    * paragraph = ordered set of topically-related sentences 
    * lead sentence sets context for paragraph and might tie to previous paragraph
    * sentences in paragraph should have logical narrative flow, relating to theme/topic
    * don’t mix tenses in descriptive text
    * one sentence paragraph: warning!

1. Put yourself in place of the reader
    * take the time to write less. less is more: 
        - I would have sent you less if I had had time”
    * readers shouldn’t have to work
        - won’t  “dig” to get story, understand context, results
        - need textual signposts to know where ‘story” is going, context to know where they are
            - **good**: “e.g., Having seen that … let us next develop a model for …. Let Z be ….”
            - **bad**: “Let Z be”
    * what does reader know/not know, want/not want?
        - write for reader, not for yourself

    * page upon page of dense text is no fun to read
        - avoid cramped feeling of tiny fonts, small margins
        - create openess with white space: figures, lists
    * enough context/information for reader to understand what you write?
        - no one has as much background/content as you
        - no one can read your mind
    * all terms/notation defined?

1. No one (not even your mother) is as interested in this topic as you
    * so you had better be (or appear) interested
    * tell readers why they should be interested in your “story”
    * don’t overload reader with 40 graphs: 
        - think about main points you want to convey with graphs
        - can’t explore entire parameter space
    * don’t overload reader with pages of equations
        - put long derivations/proofs in appendix, provide sketch in body of paper

1. State the results carefully
    * clearly state assumptions (see overstate/understate your results)
    * experiment/simulation description: enough info to nearly recreate experiment/description
    * simulation/measurements: statistical properties of your results (e.g., confidence intervals) 
    * are results presented representative? or just a corner case that makes the point you want to make

1. Don’t overstate/understate your results
    * overstatement mistake:
        - “We show that X is prevalent in the Internet”
        - “We show that X is better than Y”
      
      when only actually shown for one/small/limited cases
    
    * understatement mistake: fail to consider broader implications of your work 
        - if your result is small, interest will be small 
        - “rock the world”

1. Study the art of writing
    * writing well gives you an “unfair advantage”
    * __writing well matters in getting your work published in top venues__
    * highly recommended:
        - The Elements of Style, W. Strunk, E.B. White, Macmillan Publishing, 1979
        - Writing for Computer Science: The Art of Effective Communication, Justin Sobel, Springer 1997. 
    * who do __you__ think are the best writers in your area: __study their style__

1. Good writing takes times
    * give yourself time to reflect, write, review, refine
    * give others a chance to read/review and provide feedback
        - get a reader’s point of view
        - find a good writer/editor to critique your writing
    * starting a paper three days before the deadline, while results are still being generated, is a non-starter
