# Getting Started
You have made your first step by joining our research group on extreme scale geomecahnics. Congratulations! We look forward to working with you and have a lot of fun. We at Geoelements aim to promote open research and create a friendly team of researchers working in the area of computational geomechanics.

* Read this wiki thoroughly and familiarize yourself with how Geoelements team operates. 

* Getting around: The lab is located in ECJ 9.202. When you enter through the main doors, take the elevator to the 9th floor the lab is right next to the elevator. Krishna's office is also on the 9th floor, room 9.227B. To access the lab, we need to submit a key request form, contact Krishna to arrange a key.

* You may use your own laptop or Krishna would be happy to buy you a new laptop.

* We mainly work using Unix/Linux OS, so I recommend installing [Fedora OS](https://getfedora.org/) on your machine or using a Mac.

* Sign-up to [DesignSafe-CI](https://designsafe-ci.org/register) and share your username with Krishna so he can add you to relevant projects. DesignSafe is a CyberInfrastructure for Natural Hazard Engineering and offers access to some of the best supercomputing resources at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center - TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu).

* Please familiarise yourself with the tools and software that we use in our research group.

    - [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

    - [Git for Version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

    - [Python basics](https://kks32-courses.github.io/ce311k/README.html)

    - [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) and [C++ Large-Scale programming](https://github.com/kks32/cpp-software-development)

    - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) and [JAX](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

* We use slack to communicate within the research group for software development.

*  If you find a bug or an issue in one of our software, please open an issue request on [GitHub](https://github.com/geoelements)

* Please help us document our codes and write user manuals.

* We request you to share your work within our research group to promote knowledge sharing, preferably under [Creative Commons - Attribution Share Alike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or a similar license.

*  Use a version control system (git) and store your documents / input files and other important codes as repositories on online git hosting sites such as [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) (free academic plan).

* We encourage you to participate in development of research software and tools. Our research code aims to be consistent, follow our style guides when developing these tools. Software and tools developed within the research group are and will be distributed as open source software under MIT or other similar licenses, unless where it is specifically agreed with the supervisor. No part of research development or files will be distributed without the researchers’ or supervisor’s consent. The aim is to promote openness in research and development. You are expected to acknowledge the contribution of the members of the group on any publication.
