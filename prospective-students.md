# Applying to PhD Programs

Are you a prospective PhD student interested in joining the Geoelements research group? Then this page is for you! Answers to frequently asked questions are below. Make sure to scroll to the very end for a list of resources and tips!

## Is the Geoelements research group right for me?

Great question! Check out our website to learn more about our latest research. Then read our wiki to find out about our research group culture is like, our expectations for grad students, and what kind of mentor Krishna is (or tries him best to be)!

Our research group will be a good fit for you if (1) you find our research exciting and (2) you think that our research group culture / philosophy works well with your personality and needs. Of course, whether you ultimately decide to work in our research group should also be affected by geography (do you want to live in Austin / the US?), fit with other research group / department members (during your interview, do you feel comfortable with us? do you feel welcome and respected?), and the various benefits we offer (e.g., consider salary/stipend, teaching load, health insurance coverage, housing, leave policies, etc).

To find out more, you are completely free to ask past and current Geoelements members about their experiences in the research group, and ask as many questions as you'd like during your interview or before you apply.

Also check out the University of Texas Austin Geotech website to learn more about the department, requirements in the PhD program, and details about the application. In the Geotech group the model is that students are admitted to work in individual research groups (i.e., no rotations). 

## What qualities make me a good fit for Geoelements research group?

The follow describes more a philosophy of our group rather than an objective test of your qualities. To be a successful Geoelements researcher you should:
* Have strong technical knowledge.
* Have the willingness to try new things and not be afraid to fail.
* Have unwavering dedication to solve fundamental research problems.
* Be honest and sincere. 
* Have the motivation to learn new areas.
* Have the ability to work in a team and support one another.
* You don't need to be have strong programming skills, but we expect you to demonstrate the ability to think critically and have a strong mathematical background.
* You are willing to learn and grow. 

Ph.D. is not the goal, it's a process, we are looking for researchers who are willing to work hard and grow during this time. We would always pick a sincere, hardworking and a good student over a superstar who is not willing to change their ways or learn.

## I want to get on Krishna's radar before I submit my application. How do I do that?

Send Krishna an email! He is always happy to hear from prospective students. In fact, He highly encourages prospective students to email him before applying. That way, you can find out if He will be accepting students that year and whether your interests and experiences fit with him research group's current goals. Just drop him a note with a few sentences about your current position and interests, and attach your CV. Make sure to let him know your area of interest (don't worry if you don't yet have a specific interest).

> __How to email Krishna:__ 

If you are interested in applying, send an email with the following subject: **Geoelements + Favorite soil type:**. For e.g., if you like `sand`, your email subject should read `Geoelements sand:`. This helps me in knowing that you have read our wiki (or at least this paragraph), and shows your dedication to join our group. If you follow this guideline, I'll gurantee you an email response (which may take up to a week sometimes). Do NOT expect to hear back if you don't address the three sections in your email:

1. Specify your interest: MS/PhD or PhD
2. One-page research statement as a PDF on what research area you would like to explore and why: [https://www.geoelements.org/research/](https://www.geoelements.org/research/). See details below on what to include. 
3. Explain your interest and what makes you an ideal candidate (your fit in the group)?

### How to write an effective research statement (no more than 1 page):

Your research statement should only be one page and have the following sections: 

1. **Problem Statement**:
    - Clearly define the specific geomechanics/robotics/AI challenge or question your research intends to address.
    - Emphasize the relevance of this problem in the context of current geomechanics research.
    - Highlight any gaps in existing research that your study aims to fill.

1. **Methodology**:
    - Outline the simulation techniques, AI algorithms and robotic applications you'll use in your research.
    - Explain how these methods are suited to address the problem statement effectively.

1. **Expected Results/Outputs**:
    - Mention how these results could advance understanding or applications in geoelements.

1. **Impact**:
    - Discuss how the findings could contribute to technological advancements in simulations, AI and robotics.
    
## How do I make my research statement as strong as possible?

Krishna is interested in seeing your enthusiasm and creative thinking about areas his research group studies. If you have particular questions you are keen to explore during your PhD, feel free to tell him a few of them. Past research experience is great, but it does not substitute for creative and critical thinking, willingness to learn, and knowledge of the general field. Likewise, prior programming experience is a strength, but not essential. We love to hear from students who have passion for research, and have thought about what they want to study. No need to have highly detailed plans in place — Krishna would just like to hear about some general areas of inquiry that you are curious to study.

Krishna would also like to hear about your past research experience, if any. Do not simply list what is already on your CV, though. Tell him a little bit about why you became interested in that research question, how you tackled that question, what you learned, and what you might want to do differently in the future. Furthermore, how did your past experiences inform your current interests?

You should also have a section in your research statement describing what attracted you to University of Texas at Austin and to Krishna's research group in particular. What would you like to learn in the Geoelements and what do you hope to contribute? What is special about the Geoelements and/or UT? If you are interested in other research groups too, that's great — feel free to mention them too! But make clear which research group(s) are those of primary interest and which you would like to learn from or cooperate. It's a good idea to list at least one other research group in Geotech, because at least two faculty need to be interested in working with you in order for you to be accepted into the program.

## How big of a deal are my GREs and grades?

Note: the below is the opinion of Krishna and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of other faculty members.

Krishna does not heavily consider the GREs. There is currently a debate about the merits and demerits of the GRE, and there are good arguments on both sides. If the GRE is required by the department (it is not required for Fall 2021), Krishna will look at it but not give it heavy weight. In other words, a low GRE will not doom you, and a high GRE will not lift up an otherwise weak application.

The same is true for grades. Low grades will not necessarily hurt your chances. However, if your GPA is low, there are a couple of things you can do to improve your chances. First, have at least one of your letter writers comment on your GPA (note: you can also ask your letter writers to comment on a low GRE score). Ask them to acknowledge your GPA (or GRE) and then state whether or not it is an accurate reflection of your abilities (it is likely not an accurate reflection of your abilities). If you are comfortable with it, eithim you or them can comment on the reasons for the low GPA or GRE (e.g., having little time to devote to studying because of a full- or part-time job, having family to take care of, test anxiety, etc). This is not required, but you can do it if you are ok with it. Finally, point out parts of your grades you want to bring attention to. Did your GPA increase over time? Did you get high grades in psychology or neuroscience classes? Those would be good things to raise awareness of.

## How do I choose my letter writers?

Note: the below is the opinion of Krishna and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of other faculty members.

The best letter writer is not necessarily the most 'famous' person you know or one with the title of Professor. The best letter writers know you very well and can talk in depth about your strengths. Letters that don't do you justice can include a lukewarm letter from a well-known person, or a letter that lacks detail because the person doesn't know you very well. Detailed letters from people who know you well, and think highly of you, are ideal. If that person is a post-doc, a boss outside of academia, etc, that is ok. However, at least one of your letters should come from a mentor / professor in academia, if such a person is available.

## What is the funding situation for graduate students?

Krishna only accepts graduate students whom he can fully fund througout their PhD either as a Graduate Research Assistance (GRA) or as a Teaching Assistance. I expect you to complete your PhD in four years and will try my best to guarantee four years of funding (a stipend and tuition coverage), but they have to serve as a teaching assistant once per academic year. You are not required to bring in your own funding, although you will be encouraged to write grants to gain experience in the process.

## I'm an international student. Does that hurt my chances?

Not one bit! In the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at UT Austin, there are no restrictions on the number of international graduate students we can admit. The Geoelements has frequently interviewed and admitted international students.
