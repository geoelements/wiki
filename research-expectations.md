## Our Mission: Pioneering Transformative Research

Our goal is to conduct research that fundamentally reshapes the fields of AI, machine learning, numerical simulations, and robotics. We're not here to incrementally improve existing methods; we're here to revolutionize how these technologies are conceived, developed, and applied.

## Golden Rules for Exceptional Research

1. **Pursue Groundbreaking Ideas**: Always ask yourself, "Is this work truly worth publishing? Will it significantly advance our field?" If the answer isn't a resounding yes, it's time to aim higher.

2. **Challenge the Status Quo**: Question everything, even (especially) established norms. Be supportive of your colleagues, but never shy away from constructive criticism. Our greatest breakthroughs often come from challenging our own assumptions.

3. **Rigorous Mathematical Foundations**: Every project must have a solid theoretical underpinning. We're not just fine-tuning hyperparameters; we're developing robust algorithms with provable error bounds and capacity analyses.

4. **Tackle the Most Challenging Problems**: Regularly ask yourself, "What is the most difficult unsolved problem in our field, and how am I contributing to its solution?" If you're not working at the boundaries of what's possible, you're not pushing those boundaries forward.

5. **Maintain the Highest Standards**: As Edsger Dijkstra said, "Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward."

## Expectations for Research Meetings

1. **Written Documentation**: All meetings must have accompanying written documents outlining findings, issues, and proposed next steps. These should be distributed at least 2 hours before the meeting. We prefer detailed write-ups over PowerPoint slides.

2. **Preparation is Key**: Come to every meeting having thoroughly reviewed the distributed materials. Be prepared to engage in deep, meaningful discussions about the work.

3. **Constructive Feedback**: Offer thoughtful, specific feedback on your colleagues' work. Remember, our goal is to elevate each other's research to the highest possible standard.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

1. **Bi-Weekly Journal Clubs**: We will hold regular journal clubs to discuss state-of-the-art research. Come prepared to not just summarize, but to critically analyze and propose potential extensions or applications of the work.

2. **Effective Literature Reviews**: When reviewing existing work, don't just summarizeâ€”synthesize. Identify the core issues, explore potential ideas thoroughly, and always consider how we can push the field forward.

3. **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: While we each have our specialties, we should strive to understand and contribute to discussions across all areas of our group's research. The most innovative ideas often come from unexpected intersections of different fields.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, we're not here to publish papers for the sake of publishing. We're here to change the world through our research. Every project, every experiment, every line of code should be aimed at this lofty goal. It's a challenging standard to uphold, but it's what separates truly groundbreaking research from the mundane.

As you embark on your research journey with us, constantly ask yourself: "Am I working on something that could fundamentally change how we approach AI, ML, numerical simulations, or robotics?" If the answer is yes, you're on the right track. If it's no, it's time to aim higher.

Let's push the boundaries of what's possible, challenge our own limitations, and conduct research that will be remembered not just this year, but for decades to come.
